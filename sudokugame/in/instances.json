The goal is to fill the grid with numbers following these rules: 1) Each row must contain all numbers 1 to n_size without repetition, 2) Each column must contain all numbers 1 to n_size without repetition, 3) Each subgrid must contain all numbers 1 to n_rows without repetition. Fill in the next number on your road to solve the puzzle, by replacing any of the 0s with the correct number. Answer in the following format: '<row> <col> <value>', example: '0 0 1'. Note that row anc col values start with 0. Return nothing but the '<row> <col> <value>', otherwise the parsing won't work.",

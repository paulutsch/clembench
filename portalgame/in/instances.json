The game is played on a grid where you can move in four directions.\n\nGame Elements:\n\n- Portal (üü™): Your goal ‚Äî reaching it means success.\n- Switch (üîò): Opens and closes the door.\n- Door (üö™): A door that can be opened or closed. When closed, you cannot pass through it.\n- Regular Walls (‚¨õ): You can't pass through them.\n- Empty cells (‚¨ú): You can pass through these.\n- Unobserved cells (‚ùì): You have not explored these yet; they are currently unknown territory.\n- You can also pass through the switch (üîò) and the portal (üü™).\n\nVisibility:\n- You can only see the cells immediately around you (including diagonals)\n- The rest of the grid is hidden until you explore it\n- Your current position is marked with üë§\n\nEverytime you step onto the switch, it toggles the door's state between open and closed.\n\nGame Objective: Your goal is to find and enter the portal (üü™). Avoid getting stuck in loops.\n\nResponse Format: Write one sentence of reasoning about your move. End your response with a line of the form:\n\nDIRECTION: <letter>\n\nwhere <letter> is one of n (to move north/up), s (to move south/down), e (to move east/right), or w (to move west/left).\n\nThis line must start with DIRECTION:.",

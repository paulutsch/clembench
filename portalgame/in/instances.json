The game is played on a grid where you can move in four directions: north (n), south (s), east (e), and west (w).\n\nGame Elements:\n- Portal (P): Your goal - reaching it means success\n- Switch (S): Toggles the existence of the projected wall\n- Projected Wall (X): Initially active, blocks your path until deactivated. This wall is an illusion â€” it does not actually exist. But you believe it does.\n- Regular Walls (W): You can't pass through them\n\nYour current position is shown in the grid, along with the parts of the map you've already explored. The switch can toggle the projection of the projected wall, which you'll need to use strategically to reach the portal.\n\nMake your move by typing one of: n, s, e, w\nReturn nothing but the direction letter, otherwise the parsing won't work.",

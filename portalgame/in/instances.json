The game is played on a grid where you can move in four directions.\n\nGame Elements:\n\n- Portal (ðŸŸª): Your goal â€” reaching it means success.\n- Switch (ðŸ”˜): Toggles the projected wall off/on.\n- Projected Wall (ðŸŸ¥): This wall is an illusion. Initially active. When active, you believe it to block your path. When deactivated, the projection turns off.\n- Regular Walls (â¬›): You can't pass through them.\n- Empty or unobserved cells (â¬œ): You can pass through these.\n- You can also pass through the switch (ðŸ”˜) and the portal (ðŸŸª).\n\nEverytime you step onto the switch, it toggles the projected wall.\n\nGame Objective: Your goal is to find and enter the portal (ðŸŸª). Avoid getting stuck in loops.\n\nResponse Format: Write one sentence of reasoning about your move. End your response with a line of the form:\n\nDIRECTION: <letter>\n\nwhere <letter> is one of n (to move north/up), s (to move south/down), e (to move east/right), or w (to move west/left).\n\nThis line must start with DIRECTION:.",
